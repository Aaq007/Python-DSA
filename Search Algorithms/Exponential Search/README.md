<h1>Exponential Search</h1>

<h4>
    Exponential search is also known as doubling or galloping search. This mechanism is used to find the range where the search key may present. If L and U are the upper and lower bound of the list, then L and U both are the power of 2. For the last section, the U is the last position of the list. For that reason, it is known as exponential.

<h3> Complexity of Exponential Search Technique </h3>

<h4>
Time Complexity: O(1) for the best case. O(log2 i) for average or worst case. Where i is the location where search key is present.

Space Complexity: O(1)
